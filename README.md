# Towers-of-Hanoi

Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where you move a set of disks between three rods, following the rules that only one disk can be moved at a time and a larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller one. The goal is to transfer all disks from the first rod to the last in the fewest moves possible.

The fewest possible moves for the puzzle can be found through the equation: 2^n - 1 (In which "n' is the disk count)

My code demonstrates the most optimal way to solve the puzzle through the use of recursion, a method that involves a function calling itself to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable pieces.
